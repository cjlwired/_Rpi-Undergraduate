Hey all - the structure for the CD is identical to that of the PS3.  Please note that almost ALL of our research is held exclusively on our forum.  The PS3 and CD are the main repository for all code and images used for this semester. We hope that you find all things here easy to navigate.  Best of luck in any future PS3 Erosion endeavors - reach out to us if you have any questions!


Sincerely,

	PS3 DSIVE Team - Fall 2007

NOTE that all files on the PS3 are located in the /home/dsiveteam/workspace directory!
