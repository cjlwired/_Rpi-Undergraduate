Quick overview: look in the Final_integration folder. This folder contains the compiled code and the "conveyor belt" batch file / shell script. It does not run properly from end to end for two reasons. First, tiff2pgm could not be compiled successfully in the time allotted - we worked until the night before the presentation, but couldn't fix it. Second, kmeans exhibited unexpected behavior, producing values far outside the 0-255 range accepted by the analysis program. All programs otherwise work as expected. Code is terse and commented, limited post-presentation documentation is provided, and the forums are open to you.

In the forums, there may be references to folders named after team members, e.g. workspace/paul/hello. Paul became spe_work. Tom became libtiff_work. Carlos became convolve_work. Nick became image_work. Adjust instructions & references accordingly.
