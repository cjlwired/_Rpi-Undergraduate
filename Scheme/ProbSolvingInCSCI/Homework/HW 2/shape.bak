;; Function definition -> (drawShape position length choice color color)
;;
;; Use: This function will read in a position, a length, an integer, and two colors.
;;      Utilizing that one position, it will then proceed to draw one shape
;;      that is dependant on the integer that is sent. This function will be recursive,
;;      drawing in inscribed circle and a rectangle every other time with a shrinking length
;;      every time the function is called
;;
;; Sample Usage:
;;    (drawShape (make-posn 150 150) 100 0 'yellow 'black)
;;    (drawShape (make-posn 100 300) 100 0 'red 'green)
;;
;; Please make sure that you are aware that to use this function, you will
;; need to add the teachpack draw.ss; also, make sure that the start function
;; has been called before calling the function
