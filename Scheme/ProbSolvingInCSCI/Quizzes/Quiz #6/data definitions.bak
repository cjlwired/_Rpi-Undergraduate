;; 1) Table of Costs:

;;         The Table of Costs for traveling from one city to another will be represented as a list of lists. Following this logic,
;;    each element of the big list will stand for one row of the given table. Due to the fact that the cities will be known as 
;;    numbers and not as symbols, it will be fairly simple to extract the necessary data for a cost analysis between two cities.
